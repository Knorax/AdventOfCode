# Description
This is a simple repo to store my attempts at Advent of Code (AoC). If you copy any code from here, you are probably desperate or something... 

The goal of this repo is just to learn new languages, new ways of doing things and just having a good ol' time!

# Folder Structure
For now, everything is just separated by year, with one sub-directory for each day of the AoC. I might add a sub-directory for each language in those "day" sub-dir, but I'll see if I'm too lazy to do that or not.

# Reference
See https://adventofcode.com/ for more details about the challenge
